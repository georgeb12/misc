Welcome to my junk drawer. This is stuff I've written that may or may not be useful
to other people. 

## bash

A few bash scripts that might come in handy for other people.

- `hipster.sh`: a cute little FOSS fortune inspired by IFC's Portlandia
- `incr.sh`/`decr.sh`: Increment and decrement file names in batch
- `ext-swap.sh`: Change the file extension of a batch of files
- `tga2png.sh`: Convert `tga` files to `png` files
- `cat-files.sh`: Combine several text files into one megafile.

## stats

These are scripts that illustrate a few statistical concepts. I highly recommend checking out the multivariate normal/t random matrix work.

- `mvrt/`: Multivariate normal/t random matrix generator
- `jackknife/`: Jackknife resampling
- `permutations/`: Combinatorials and permutations
- `bayes.r`: Bayesian statistics
- `gradations.r`: Solving the normal equations using a real life example

## vmd

Some `tcl` procs that are handy for getting around in [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (Visual Molecular Dynamics). I may also include my `.vmdrc` file here to provide an example of how to set up a custom startup settings file.
